This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned during physical activity based on individual physiological and exercise-related parameters. The aim is to help users better understand how factors like age, gender, weight, height, heart rate, duration of exercise, and body temperature impact calorie expenditure.

The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle and preprocessed using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover insights, detect outliers, and visualize key relationships using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The model was trained using XGBoost Regressor, known for its high performance in structured data tasks. Hyperparameter tuning was carried out to improve accuracy. Evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² Score were used to assess model performance.

The final solution offers accurate, personalized predictions of calorie burn, and can be applied in fitness tracking, personalized workout planning, or health-tech solutions.
