**üî¨ Project Title:** *Calorie Burn Prediction Using Machine Learning*

**üìå Description:**

This project aims to accurately predict the number of calories burned during exercise based on personal and physiological data. It leverages machine learning to help users, fitness professionals, or health platforms estimate calorie expenditure using measurable inputs like:

* Age
* Gender
* Height
* Weight
* Duration of activity
* Heart rate
* Body temperature

A clean and structured dataset from Kaggle was used, followed by extensive **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **feature engineering**. Visualizations were created to identify trends and correlations between variables using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**.

For model training, the **XGBoost Regressor** algorithm was implemented due to its robustness and efficiency for regression problems. The model was fine-tuned to improve accuracy and evaluated using metrics such as **R¬≤ Score**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**.

The final model provides accurate, personalized calorie predictions and can be integrated into fitness applications, wearables, or digital health platforms to enhance workout planning and performance tracking.

**‚úÖ Skills & Concepts Applied:**

* Data Cleaning & Visualization
* Regression Modeling with XGBoost
* Model Evaluation & Fine-tuning
* Real-world Application of Predictive Analytics

**üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies:**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, Google Colab
