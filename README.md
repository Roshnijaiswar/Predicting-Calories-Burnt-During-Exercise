# Predicting-Calories-Burnt-During-Exercise
Built a machine learning model to predict the number of calories burned during exercise 
based on user-specific parameters such as age, gender, height, weight, duration, heart rate, and body temperature.
ðŸ’¡ Key Features:
Applied XGBoost Regressor for high-accuracy predictions

Performed feature engineering and data cleaning using Pandas

Evaluated the model using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² Score

Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and trend analysis

Final model helps understand how different physical parameters affect calorie burn

ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost, scikit-learn, Google Colab
